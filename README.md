# CitiBike Bike Sharing 

## Overview
###
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an understanding of the profitability of the CitiBike bike sharing model to understand if it would be feasible to roll out to Des Moines, Iowa.
The results of the bike sharing data from New York City is used to determine the following factors:
- How many customers and subscribers use CitiBike?
- What is the gender breakdown of users?
- How often are CitiBikes used and what is the daily usage pattern?
- How long are the bikes rented for?

## Results of Analysis:
###
By using Tableau to visualize the results, we can determine that the majority of CitiBike users are subscribers (81%) compared to occasional users (18.9%).
When looking at usage by gender can gain additional insight as 65.28% of all riders are male and 25.1% are female.  This could be an important consideration understanding the type of bike required for customer.  Analysis has also shown that lowest usage occurs between 1-4am, which is when it is recommended to complete bicycle maintenance in order to minimize impact for users.

## Summary of Analysis:
###
The CitiBike bike sharing model is very successful in New York City.  In 2019, New York City had a population of 8.4 million and in August alone there were 2.3 million users of CitiBikes.  In order to understand if the CitiBike model can be scaled and successful in Des Moines there are a few important considerations to understand.
- The population of Des Moines in 2019 is 699,292 vs. 8.4 million in New York City
- The square milage of Des Moines is 88.2 sq. miles with a population density of 2,389.70/sq mile as compared to New York which is 300.46 sq miles and a population density of 27,400/sq mile.

In order to truly gauge the feasibility of CitiBike in Des Moines it is recommended that similar bike sharing data is compared from other cities in the US that are similar in size, demographic and weather.  While the CitiBike program is extremely successful in New York City, the differences are too great to be able to predict if this model would be successful in Des Moines with a high degree of certainty.  Additional analysis is recommended by comparing the bike sharing results of Washington, DC and Columbus, Ohio, both of which had similar population to Des Moines in 2019.
